## 🧭 About Me

My name is **Kr88qtr**, I’m 15 years old and I live in **Switzerland**.  
I'm currently building a **strategic path** toward cybersecurity with one goal in mind:  
🎯 **Work in cybersecurity in Japan.**  

I'm preparing a Swiss **IT apprenticeship (CFC)**, learning as a self-taught student, developing a solid GitHub, and improving both **technical skills** and a **tactical mindset**.

## 🧠 Mindset & Strategy

> "80% of cybersecurity is psychology."

I’m actively working on:  
- Emotional control  
- Tactical mental strategy (inspired by **Ayanokoji** / **Johan Liebert**)  
- Cold observation, logic, patience  
- Daily discipline and consistency  
- Thinking like an attacker in a defensive world
